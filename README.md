Hi, Assalamu Alaikum (May peace be upon you) Iâ€™m @Tronayy. My name is Usman and I'm from Islamabad, Pakistan.

I am a Full-stack Web Developer as well as an Avionics Engineer. Coding is my personal interest and I love the fact that this field has no boundaries. I strive to learn more and more.

I've worked on a number of projects that include coding of microcontrollers during my bachelor's degree. For more information about my studies and my work you can look up my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/usmanfazal/

You can contact me for work on my upwork account: https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01a764acd40ed5ca23

Let me know if you need any help, I'd love to help out!
